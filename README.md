# Formula 1 Data Analysis with DBMS and Power BI Dashboard
## Project Overview
This project utilizes a relational database management system (DBMS) to manage and analyze Formula 1 racing data. The data is loaded into SQL tables from various CSV files and then analyzed using SQL queries. A Power BI dashboard is used to visualize the results, providing insights into various aspects of Formula 1 races, such as driver standings, lap times, and race results.

## Setup Instructions

 #### Clone the repository
```bash
https://github.com/mety0r/F1-Analytics.git
```

#### Database Setup:

- Ensure you have a MySQL database installed.
- Run the provided SQL scripts to create and populate the tables.
- The CSV files must be available locally on your system to load the data into the respective tables.
```bash
  CREATE DATABASE formula1;
USE formula1;
-- Run the SQL commands to create tables and load data from CSV files.
```

#### Loading CSV Data
- Modify the file paths in the LOAD DATA statements to match the location of the CSV files on your system.
```bash
   LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'C:/path/to/circuits.csv'
INTO TABLE circuits
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS;
```
#### Power BI Setup:

- Import the SQL data into Power BI.
- Use the pre-designed dashboard template (if available) to visualize the data.
